# üéπ AI-Powered Piano Trainer

This project uses a Raspberry Pi, USB webcam, and a YOLOv8 model to detect pressed piano keys in real time. It compares detected keys to a predefined melody (‚ÄúTwinkle Twinkle Little Star‚Äù) and provides instant feedback using an LCD display, buzzer, and logging system.

Originally built as a school project for Creative Technologies & AI (CTAI) 2025 at Howest.

##  How It Works (Quick Overview)

1. The Pi captures live video frames from the webcam.
2. Frames are sent to the laptop via socket.
3. The laptop runs YOLOv8 model inference to detect which key is pressed.
4. The detected key is sent back to the Pi over a second socket.
5. The Pi compares it with the expected song sequence and:
   - Displays result on LCD
   - Logs data to CSV
   - Plays buzzer melody at end
   - Prompts user to replay
