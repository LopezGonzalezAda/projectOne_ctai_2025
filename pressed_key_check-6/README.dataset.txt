**AI-Powered Piano Trainer**

This project uses computer vision and a custom-trained object detection model to detect which piano keys are pressed. It compares them to the correct sequence of a song and gives the user an accuracy score at the end. It runs on a Raspberry Pi and laptop, with a camera, LCD screen, and buzzer for interaction.
